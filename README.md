The intention for this repo is to gain some experience working with Google's Gemini API. I will be using the free teir of Gemini.

## Move Guessing Game

This is a game in which the player is given a redacted version of a movie blurb and guesses the movie. Gemini will then give a clue about the correct film and the user will be given a slightly less redacted version of the blurb. This will carry on until the player gets the movie correct.

## Project Ideas

- Hobbit-esque riddle game
- Maths tutoring question maker
- More?
